Some of the advantages of Tricalc 80 are:
 
- It uses a new high-performance algorithm for seismic calculation, called FEAST, that reduces the computation time and uses all the available RAM and processors.
- It includes a new software assistant that allows you to define parametric 3D grids with automatic assignment of sections and groups.
- It generates a comprehensive structural calculation report that contains all the computation details and the assumed solution. You can export this report to docx or pdf format and modify it as you wish.
- It offers advanced and transparent analysis options, such as second-order analysis by P-Delta method, finite element method for walls and slabs, interaction between foundation slabs and structure, etc.
- It allows you to define structures on any plane: horizontally, vertically, inclined or curved. You can also work simultaneously in floor and elevation with up to 10 graphic windows.
- It produces high-quality graphs and drawings that can be exported to EMF/WMF format. You can also create automatic plans compositions with construction details in DWG format.
- It automatically generates the broken down measurements of every structure element in ASCII, Gest or FIEBDC formats. It also includes a bi-directional link with Gest program and other budget programs.
